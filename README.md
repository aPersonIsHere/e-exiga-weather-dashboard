# e-exiga-weather-dashboard
The Git Repository for Emmanuel Exiga's Weather Dashboard.

# Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to challenge my knowledge in JavaScript (with the inclusion of jQuery and Bootstrap), CSS, and HTML to create a weather dashboard with the OpenWeather 3rd-party API. The program is planned to display a 5-day forecast with much more information.

# How To Use the Site
Enter a city into the search bar at the top left. Then click the "Search" button. In the Developer Tab (on Google Chome) for the Console tab, information will be displayed in the console log.
